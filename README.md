## Disclaimer:
> This application contains no copyrighted material!<br>
> It simply contains lists of 8-character strings of text which are freely available online.<br>
> This application simply sends strings of text to a port on a local server, which can be accomplished using many other applications such as PostMan or even via command-prompt using Curl.

## Installation:
> 1. Download the latest version of AK Card Scanner from the [**releases page**](<https://github.com/Gama-Tech/AK-Card-Scanner-Releases/releases>).
> 
> 2. Extract the contents to a folder on your PC.
> 
> 3. Double-click `AKCardScanner.exe` to start the application.<br>
> If you changed the Arcade I/O HTTP Server's port in the emulator, you'll need to set the same port in the Card Scanner application.

> 
> **USB Barcode Scanners<br>**
> If you have a USB barcode scanner you can use this to scan cards you physically own.<br>
> Simply click inside the `Custom Barcode` text box then scan your card.<br>
> Your barcode scanner should enter the code for you and send it automatically.<br>
> **NOTE:** The above method will only work for USB barcode scanners that emulate keyboard input.


## Other Platforms:
> If you're using a non-Windows platform I highly suggest trying [**Card Collections**](<https://github.com/Bebeq/Card-Collections>) by [**Bebeq**](<https://github.com/Bebeq>).<br>
> Card Collections allows you to display, store, and send barcode data via a cross-platform web server application.<br>
> You can even scan barcodes directly using a mobile device.
