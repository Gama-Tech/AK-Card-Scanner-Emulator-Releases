# AK Card Scanner

This application allows you to send barcode data to the Play! (https://github.com/jpd002/Play-) emulator's "Arcade I/O HTTP Server".

## Scanning a card (Windows)
> 1. Download the latest version of AK Card Scanner Emulator  [**HERE**](<https://github.com/Gama-Tech/AK-Card-Scanner-Releases/releases/tag/release>)
> 
> 2. Extract the contents to a folder on your PC.
> 
> 3. Double-click `AKCardScanner.exe` to start the program.
> If you changed the Arcade I/O HTTP Server's port in the emulator, you'll need to set the same port in the Card Scanner program. 
> 
> Now you have 3 ways to scan cards.
> 
> **Pre-loaded Cards**
> Select an Animal, Strong & Miracle card from the dropdown boxes and click `Scan Card` when the game prompts you to. So far this program contains card from Version 1 up to Evo 1.
> If you select 1 of each card types then you'll be given the option to send all 3 at once.
> The application will display a progress bar as it scans each card in sequence.
> 
> **Custom Cards**
> If you'd like to enter a barcode that isn't in the dropdown lists, you can enter the code manually in the `Custom Barcode` text box and click `Scan Card`.
> 
> **USB Barcode Scanners**
> Additionally, if you have a USB barcode scanner you can use this to scan cards you physically own. Simply click inside the `Custom Barcode` text box then scan your card.
> Your barcode scanner should enter the code for you and send it automatically.
> **NOTE:** The above method will only work for USB barcode scanners that emulate keyboard input.
